Union home minister Amit Shah hit out at the INDIA alliance, saying no matter how many parties come together, PM Modi will still win the election.Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday lashed out at Congress MP Rahul Gandhi over the latter accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of trying to do "match-fixing" in the Lok Sabha polls.At a rally in New Delhi's Ramlila Maidan on Sunday, Gandhi had said,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying to do match fixing in these elections. Without EVMs, match-fixing, social media, and pressurizing the press, they cannot win more than 180 seats." Gandhi further said that the Constitution will cease to exist if the BJP registers victory in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.

In his all out attack on the Congress MP, Shah said,"Rahul Gandhi’s grandmother imposed an emergency and put lakhs of people behind bars. Now he has no right to speak about democracy." “In the last five years during Congress rule various pilgrimage sites were attacked many people were killed. But the people who believed in appeasement did justice to none. But we appease none and are committed to justice for everybody. They should know that 0+0 is equal to zero always. No matter how hard they try Modi Ji will be reelected. No matter how many parties come together, Modi will still win the election,” the minister said at the Bharatiya Janata Party's Shakti Kendra Pramukh Sammelan in Rajasthan's Jodhpur.

US President Joe Biden made a blunder while reminiscing about his favourite moments spent at the White House ahead of the annual White House Easter Egg Roll.US President Joe Biden made a blunder while reminiscing about his favourite moments spent at the White House ahead of the annual White House Easter Egg Roll.“Our kids jumping in bed with us,” Biden responded, before realising that he was supposed to mention his grandkids. He then corrected himself, citing the times his grandchildren would just sneak up on him and jump in his bed.
“Our grandkids, when they are down here, just sneaking up and jumping in bed with us," the POTUS said, adding that “That’s my favorite memory here.”Biden, who has seven grandchildren, went on to say that "they all love wandering through the halls" because there are several bedrooms and two floors upstairs. 

Targetting Biden for attempting another blunder, one of the users wrote on X, “Disgusting”, while another added, “Ooops”. “He always says the secret out loud, what else are we to think? Lol,” one more user mocked the US President Joe Biden, First Lady Jill spent Easter weekend with grandchildren. Before taking part in the White House's annual Easter Egg Roll celebration, the 81-year-old commander in chief along with Jill Biden, the US First Lady, enjoyed a family egg hunt at Camp David with their children and grandchildren.

CJI DY Chandrachud said the probe agencies should concentrate on crimes that threaten security and economic health of the country and public order Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud on Monday called for a ‘delicate balance' between the search and seizure powers vested with probe agencies like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and an individual's right to privacy.“In the realm of criminal justice, the delicate balance between search and seizure powers and individual privacy rights stands and this is at the cornerstone of a fair and just society,” the CJI was quoted by PTI as saying during his keynote address at the 20th D P Kohli memorial lecture in the Capital.the CJI was quoted by PTI as saying during his keynote address at the 20th D P Kohli memorial lecture in the Capital. 

According to the PTI report, the CJI also flagged what he called ‘unwarranted confiscation of personal devices’, saying there was a pressing need to strike a balance between investigative imperatives and individual privacy rights.Asking the probe agencies to “pick their battles” instead of spreading out too thinly in various cases, the CJI said they should “concentrate on crimes that threaten security and economic health of the country and public order.” "The landscape of crime is evolving at an "unprecedented pace" and probe agencies like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) must build their capacities to tackle them apart from harnessing Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools," added.

Royals notched up their third straight win while 5-time champions MI suffered their third defeat to pile pressure on skipper Hardik Pandya. An incisive opening burst by pace ace Trent Boult and magical spin bowling by leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal helped Rajasthan Royals thrash hosts Mumbai Indians by six wickets with 27 balls to spare in the IPL at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday.In a lop-sided game, Royals restricted MI to 125/9 after electing to bowl. Powered by Riyan Parag’s unbeaten 54 (39b, 5x4, 3x6), the visitors chased down the target in 15.3 overs. It was Parag’s second successive fifty, having scored an unbeaten 84 versus Delhi Capitals. Royals went top of the table with their third straight win while MI are at the bottom following their third consecutive defeat. Under pressure to stem the poor start, it was that sort of an outing where nothing worked for the home side starting with the toss.Boult's superb spell with the new ball rocked MI and they never recovered from there. 
The left-arm pacer, who has bowled some inspired spells during his time with MI, silenced the home crowd with his first eight deliveries itself. The New Zealand seamer picked three wickets in four balls to enjoy figures of 1.2-0-2-3 and reduce MI to 14/3. It was a dramatic opening spell with Rohit Sharma, Naman Dhir and Dewald Brevis all out for golden ducks.
